# Flux Tutorials

This repository contains flux tutorials! It is an experiment to get ready
for testing a new lab playground where a visitor can request a notebook
to try out lab software. The repository will provide (optionally)
automated builds for containers, or just notebooks that use containers
elsewhere (e.g., Flux already has automated builds alongside the repository).
These tutorials originally came from [the officials tutorials repository](https://github.com/flux-framework/Tutorials).
